        Designed a testboard system for a clock-data-recovery chip using Altium Designer.
        
        * Calculated the characteristic impedance of transmission line to decrease the reflection and increase the transmission of the high frequency signals.
        * Modeled and simulated the differential coplanar waveguide on board, using Advanced Design System.
        * Chose a kind of low dropout regulator for the powerboard according to key parameters and used multiple decoupling capacitors to depress the current ripple.
