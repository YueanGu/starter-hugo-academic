  - title: 64baud/s Optical Transmitter Driver Chip Tapeout
    company: State Key Laboratory of semiconductor superlattices, supervised by Prof. Nan Qi
    company_url: ''
#   company_logo: org-gc
    location: Beijing, China
    date_start: '2022-08-31'
    date_end: ''
    description: |2-
        Working on designing a silicon photonic micro-ring based 64baud/s based optical transmitter with 2-tap Feed-Forward Equalization(FFE) and nonlinear equalization in 45nm SOI CMOS.
        
        *Currently focusing on designing Cherry-Hooper structure continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) stage and 2-stage variable gain amplifier(VGA). 
        *Expected to realize 15dB boost and 12 dB gain within the bandwidth of 35G. Modeled CTLE in Advanced Design System and wrote verilog-A model in Virtuoso to optimize circuit design.
        *Expected to tapeout in November.


  - title: Professor of Semiconductor Physics
    company: Berkeley Wireless Research Center(BWRC), University of California, Berkeley
    company_url: ''
    location: Beijing, China
    date_start: '2016-01-01'
    date_end: '2020-12-31'
    description: |2-
        Evaluated DC characteristics of transistors in the commercial 45nm PD-SOI processfor down to 2.5K cryogenic temperatures on different types of devices.
        
        * Extracted key design parameters and analyzed them with the corresponding low-temperature effect.
        * Introduced an effective temperature formulation to capture the effects of the band tail states and presented a compact model that corrects the low-temperature threshold voltage for the band-tail states, Fermiâ€“Dirac statistics, and interface traps.
        * Used Cadence Virtuoso and Matlab to model the experimental data of 45nm PDSOI CMOS from room temperature down to cryogenic temperatures.

  - title: Designed a testboard system for a clock-data-recovery chip
    company: GenCoin

    location: Beijing, China
    date_start: '2021-01-01'
    date_end: ''
    description:
    #description: |3-
        Designed a testboard system for a clock-data-recovery chip using Altium Designer.        
        * Calculated the characteristic impedance of transmission line to decrease the reflection and increase the transmission of the high frequency signals.
        * Modeled and simulated the differential coplanar waveguide on board, using Advanced Design System.
        * Chose a kind of low dropout regulator for the powerboard according to key parameters and used multiple decoupling capacitors to depress the current ripple.
