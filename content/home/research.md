        * Deploying

  - title: Professor of Semiconductor Physics
    company: Berkeley Wireless Research Center(BWRC), University of California, Berkeley

    location: Beijing, China
    date_start: '2016-01-01'
    date_end: '2020-12-31'
    description: |2-
        Evaluated DC characteristics of transistors in the commercial 45nm PD-SOI processfor down to 2.5K cryogenic temperatures on different types of devices.
        
        * Extracted key design parameters and analyzed them with the corresponding low-temperature effect.
        * Introduced an effective temperature formulation to capture the effects of the band tail states and presented a compact model that corrects the low-temperature threshold voltage for the band-tail states, Fermiâ€“Dirac statistics, and interface traps.
        * Used Cadence Virtuoso and Matlab to model the experimental data of 45nm PDSOI CMOS from room temperature down to cryogenic temperatures.

        Designed a testboard system for a clock-data-recovery chip using Altium Designer.
        
        * Calculated the characteristic impedance of transmission line to decrease the reflection and increase the transmission of the high frequency signals.
        * Modeled and simulated the differential coplanar waveguide on board, using Advanced Design System.
        * Chose a kind of low dropout regulator for the powerboard according to key parameters and used multiple decoupling capacitors to depress the current ripple.
