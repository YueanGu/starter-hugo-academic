  - title: 64baud/s Optical Transmitter Driver Chip Tapeout
    company: State Key Laboratory of semiconductor superlattices, supervised by Prof. Nan Qi
    company_url: ''
#   company_logo: org-gc
    location: Beijing, China
    date_start: '2022-08-31'
    date_end: ''
    description: |2-
        Working on designing a silicon photonic micro-ring based 64baud/s based optical transmitter with 2-tap Feed-Forward Equalization(FFE) and nonlinear equalization in 45nm SOI CMOS.
        
        * Currently focusing on designing Cherry-Hooper structure continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) stage and 2-stage variable gain amplifier(VGA). 
        * Expected to realize 15dB boost and 12 dB gain within the bandwidth of 35G. Modeled CTLE in Advanced Design System and wrote verilog-A model in Virtuoso to optimize circuit design.
        * Expected to tapeout in November.


  - title: 45RFSOI Mosfet Modeling Down to Cryogenic Temperatures
    company: Berkeley Wireless Research Center(BWRC), University of California, Berkeley
    company_url: ''
    location: Berkeley , U.S.
    date_start: '2022-03-13'
    date_end: '2020-08-13'
    description: |2-
        Evaluated DC characteristics of transistors in the commercial 45nm PD-SOI process down to 2.5K on different types of devices.
        
        * Introduced an effective temperature formulation to capture the effects of the band tail states.
        * Extracted key design parameters including threshold voltage, effective mobility and saturation velocity, presented a modified verilog-A compact model within industry-standard Berkeley short-channel IGFET model (BSIM) framework.
        * Introduced polynomial functions to replace the original threshold voltage expression in BSIM model, which has discontinuity points at cryogenic temperatures. Modelled id-vd curve and id-vg curve with a wide temperature range and mean absolute percentage error is smaller than 0.1 percent.

  - title: High-Speed PCB Design and Layout
    company: State Key Laboratory of semiconductor superlattices, supervised by Prof. Nan Qi
    company_url: ''
    location: Beijing, China
    date_start: '2021-07-26'
    date_end: '2021-09-13'
    description:|2-
        Designed high-speed evaluation boards for 4Ã—25Gb/s De-Serializer with Baud-Rate Sampling CDR in Altium Designer.
	  
        *  Signal integrity: Designed differential coplanar waveguide on board, calculated characteristic impedance of transmission line to decrease reflection using SI9000 and simulated its performance using Advanced Design System.
        *  Power integrity: Used multiple decoupling capacitors to depress the current ripple and magnetic beadso suppress high-frequency noise and spike interference on signal circuits and power circuits.
