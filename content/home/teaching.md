    description: |2-
        Working on designing a silicon photonic micro-ring based 64baud/s based optical transmitter with 2-tap Feed-Forward Equalization(FFE) and nonlinear equalization in 45nm SOI CMOS.
        
        * Currently focusing on designing Cherry-Hooper structure continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) stage and 2-stage variable gain amplifier(VGA). 
        * Expected to realize 15dB boost and 12 dB gain within the bandwidth of 35GHz. Modeled CTLE in Advanced Design System and wrote verilog-A model in Virtuoso to optimize circuit design.
        * Expected to tapeout in November.
